# my_radio_finder

a simple radio app, not a mona lisa, I wanted to try to do a simple but cool radio app within 8 hours but had to give up at 10 hours.
Works but very simple.

Using flutter plugins:
flutter_bloc
dio
equatable
text_scroll
cached_network_image
radio_player

and the free radio api https://api.radio-browser.info/
