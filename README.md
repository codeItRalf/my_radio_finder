# my_radio_finder

a simple radio app, not a mona lisa, I wanted to try to do a simple but cool radio app within 8 hours but had to stop after 10 hours.
Works but very simple.  

Will continue to fix small bugs and other anoying things.

For latest fat APK (Android)  [Download](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1mK242-aEcu0clztejyNcDBV77C18_D7t/view?usp=sharing).
Have a look how it works on  [Youtube](https://youtube.com/shorts/zuLtKCJfPAg?feature=share). 

Using flutter plugins:  
flutter_bloc  
dio  
equatable  
text_scroll  
cached_network_image  
radio_player  
  
and the free radio api https://api.radio-browser.info/
