# my_radio_finder

a simple radio app, not a mona lisa, I wanted to try to do a simple but cool radio app within 8 hours but had to give up at 10 hours.
Works but very simple.

Using flutter plugins:\n
flutter_bloc\n
dio\n
equatable\n
text_scroll\n
cached_network_image\n
radio_player\n
\n
and the free radio api https://api.radio-browser.info/
